It's a CRUD single-page application built with AngularJS and VanillaCSS (in other words, with no CSS frameworks). The application is a to-do list, where the user can add, view, update or delete tasks. The data is saved in the LocalStorage. The layout is responsive to be used in desktop, tablet and smartphone.
